# leaflet-challenge
Using JavaScript and a GeoJSON source (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), I was assigned in creating a world map containing live Earthquake data. For this map, I chose to plot all earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or greater that have happened within the last 7 days. First, I created the map, the map layers, and the legend. From there, I was able to create the earthquake markers and their locations, informational popups, and some additional formatting within both the JavaScript and CSS files. This map stays up to date with the latest earthquake data available.

For adding the legend correctly into the js file and CSS file, LA Angel (slack username amilla) helped me and referred me to this link for the correct syntax: https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/
Additionally, I used the Xpert Learning Assistant AI system in BootCampSpot to help me find detailed syntax errors (indentation, missing brackets, misspelled variables, etc).
